### cargame

In this game you race with a car from start to finish. First player to finish wins.

The game features single-player, multiplayer and also racing against replays/ghosts.

The game uses deterministic physics to implement multiplayer and replays. Replays are just recorded inputs and in multiplayer the game replays inputs in real-time.

There is also a server browser for discovering servers in LAN which is implemented with mDNS. Any player can host a game and others can join.

Here is a video showing me racing in singleplayer against replays:
